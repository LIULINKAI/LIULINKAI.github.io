I received my bachelor's degree in data science and big data technology from China University of Geosciences. During this period, I mainly studied the application of big data computing frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark, database management, and computer vision.
I am currently studying for a master's degree at the School of Intelligent Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on computer vision-related fields. Especially in human-object interaction detection, scene understanding of autonomous driving, including vehicle and pedestrian behavior detection, etc.
