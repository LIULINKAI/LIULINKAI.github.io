I am currently studying for a master's degree at the School of Intelligent Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University, focusing on computer vision-related fields. Especially in human-object interaction detection, scene understanding of autonomous driving, including vehicle and pedestrian behavior detection, etc. During my undergraduate studies, I majored in data science and big data technology, focusing on the application of big data computing frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark, database management, and computer vision.


Research Interests
------
- **Visual Attention**: Attention Prediction, Scanpath Prediction, Attention-Guided Deep Model
- **Human-centric Perception**: Intention, Interaction, Behavior, VQA for Blind People
- **Autonomous Driving Perception**: Traffic Scene Graph, Driving Behavior Understanding
